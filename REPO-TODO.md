# This file documents known items-yet-to-be-completed for the repo.

- Verification of non-sunny-day scenarios
- More required providers
- Should get some linting soon, and versioning workflow
- Raising/finding github provider tickets to link to workarounds
- Testing previous 'new repo' runner test with github individual owner (was an org used here because of a similar provider bug?)
- Add louder notifications about the use of a PAT and exactly where it will go (State, GH secrets)
