# Simple Smart Template Baseline Example

This example creates a smart template baseline repository from the module in the `modules` directory. The smart template baseline is a repository which has the minimal set of files and configuration necessary to be considered a smart template.

The example creates a repository with a chosen name and initializes it with a smart template baseline. If the `name` variable is left as `generate` then the repository will be named `ex-<random>-template`. The repository is initialized with a single `main` branch.

The example is intended to be used as a starting point for creating more complex smart templates.
